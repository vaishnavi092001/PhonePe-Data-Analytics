## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The project uses a relational dataset with ~483,000 records across six tables:

| Dataset | Description |
|------|------------|
| Users | User profile and onboarding data |
| Transactions | Transaction amount, service type, and date |
| Loans | Loan type, amount, and approval status |
| Insurance | Policy details, premium amount, payment status |
| Money_Transfer | P2P transfer details and failure reasons |
| Recharge_Bills | Mobile, DTH, electricity & utility payments |

> 📌 Data was extracted from a MySQL database and processed using Python.

## 📊 Dashboards
Power BI dashboards were created for:
- Overall Transaction Performance
- Loans Analysis
- Insurance Premium Analysis
- Money Transfer Trends
- Recharge & Bills Performance  

These dashboards provide **real-time-style KPIs**, trends, and success/failure analysis.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Payment success rate consistently above **95%**
- **Loans & Insurance** are the highest revenue contributors
- High-frequency users generate significantly higher revenue
- Transaction peaks align with **salary cycles and festive seasons**
- Minimal failures mostly due to server errors or incorrect PINs

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Real-time analytics using streaming data
- Customer segmentation using clustering techniques
- Cloud-based ETL and dashboard automation
